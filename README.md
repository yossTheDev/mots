## üöÄ Features

* Intuitive and easy to use commands
* CORS enabled by default
* Hosts multiple folders
* Makes fake APIs to test your apps **PREFABS**

## üì¶ Prefabs

MOTS allows you to create fake apis called Prefabs, these are configurable files with the structure of an API able to respond to parameters and define a response based on this, it can be a file, an html page or anything.

This feature is intended to help developers to test their apps without the need to have developed an API before or without the need to be connected all the time.

### Creating Prefabs

To create a new Prefab you must enter the following command

    mots prefab create [NAME]
Just provide a name for the new Prefab.

It will indicate the folder on your computer where it has been saved. For example

    üíæ Prefab Saved in /home/user/.local/share/mots/prefabs/new.json

This newly created prefab already has a default structure designed as a starting point, now try to serve it with the following command
  
     mots prefab [NAME]

Try entering in your browser the following url to see the change of the parameters **localhost:4004/?user=you**

All prefabs contain the following structure

``` json
{
  "port": 4004,
  "paths": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "folder": "",
      "response": "<h1>MOTS loves you $USER</h1><h2>Add ?user=[ANY] to url to change the bear for a name or anything else</h2>",
      "params": [{ "name": "user", "default": "üêº", "isRequired": false }],
      "status": 200
    },
    {
      "name": "/Error",
      "folder": "",
      "response": "<h1>Not Found</h1>",
      "status": 404
    },
    {
      "name": "/Success",
      "folder": "",
      "response": "<h1>Yes, you can üî•</h1>",
      "status": 200
    }
  ]
}

```

As you can see they are json files, with different properties easy to understand for any programmer üòÅ
